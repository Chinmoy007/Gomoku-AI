# Gomoku
Gomoku, also called Five in a Row, is an abstract strategy board game. 
It is traditionally played with Go pieces (black and white stones) on a Go board, using 15×15 of the 19×19 grid intersections.
Because pieces are not moved or removed from the board, Gomoku may also be played as a paper and pencil game.

 # Gomoku: In this project
 Here we build the exact gomoku game that described avobe with `10x10` board. The game is AI based. AI uses Minimax algorithm to find the best move against the human moves. The player who makes five in a row will win the game. To understand better, watch the project demonstration.
